h2. Overview
This project contains several algorithms used in the bioinformatics domain.
More documentation will come soon - please be patient!

Highlights so far
* generic (2D) dynamic programing algorithm
* Global, semi-local and local aligment
* Pattern recognization with the Viterbi-algorithm (hidden markov model)
* RNA 2D struct viewer based on Nussinov algorithm
* Greedy superstring algorithm for sequence assembly
* and many more...

h2. Getting Started
More documentation will come soon. A good start is to read the scaladoc
API documentation. See installation below where to find it.

h3. Requirements
* "GIT":http://git-scm.com/
* "Maven 2":http://maven.apache.org/

h3. Installation
The project uses Maven 2 as the build tool. Check out the project and
run the Maven goal mvn site. This will generate all the relevant artifacts.
The scaladoc can be found in ./target/site/index.html

h2. Mailing Lists
None yet. :-)     

h2. History
The software was originally developed for a lecture on "bioinformatics":http://www.mi.hs-mannheim.de/gumbel/aktuelle-vorlesungen/bioinformatik-bim/.
